## rules?

---

- each one should create its one branch
- push changes to remote regularly to see the progress the other has and be able to discuss with comments
- before the deadline we will merge the changes to main and submit that
- avoid uploading the data, just upload the jupyter notebook
  - should we add a git ignore for .csv files?
